  <h1>Headings Structure</h1>
  <p>
    There is a difference in headings between native apps and hybrids with embedded HTML content.
    While there are six levels of headings in HTML h1 to h6, this is not the case with native apps.

  <h2>Output of screen reader</h2>
  <h3>Native Apps</h3>
  <p>
    You may have noticed that the heading "Alternative Texts", unlike the heading "Heading Structure",
    has been announced by mobile screen readers as "Heading Alternative Texts" only. This is a text formatted as a heading on a non-visual level.
  </p>
  <h3>HTML content</h3>
  <p>
    For HTML documents, for example, a mobile screen reader says "HTML content heading 3". Since it is a heading of the third heading level (h3). No matter whether an HTML document is called up in a browser or integrated into an app, screen readers always says the headings in the same way.

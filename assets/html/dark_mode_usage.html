<h1>Help</h1>
<p>
    The app is intended to give you your first experience with the built-in screen reader in Android. It does not matter whether you are an Android developer yourself or not. It can also be used in a training course or as an evaluation tool for automated test tools to check the accessibility of apps.

</p>
<p>
    In order to be able to use the app, you must activate the screen reader Talkback (or VoiceAssistant on Samsung devices)
</p>

<h2>Activate the screen reader:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Open Settings</li>
    <li>Scroll down to Accessibility and open it.</li>
    <li>Scroll to TalkBack and open it</li>
    <li>Activate TalkBack with the button next to "Use TalkBack".</li>
    <li>You may need to give Talkback some permissions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    If you do not have any experience with Talkback, it is advisable to work through the introduction that appears when you start it for the first time.
</p>

<h2>General layout of the screens</h2>
<p>


    Each screen contains two visually identical examples of typical elements that
    re often used in Android apps (e.g. input fields, graphics, graphic buttons, etc.).
    The upper example of the two was implemented without consideration of accessibility
    and the lower example was implemented with consideration of accessibility.
    If you go through the examples with Talkback, you can hear the differences between
    the two examples.
